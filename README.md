# MetaBonk (Pure Vision Stack)

This repository implements a headless-first, GPU-only reinforcement learning stack with:

- Pure vision learning (no menu/scene labels in the worker control loop)
- GPU preprocessing via cuTile (CUDA 13.1+)
- Centralized System2/VLM cognitive server
- Verified streaming + watchdogs for black/frozen feeds
